# MyGameList

This app will be a way of keeping track of games you have played, while also allowing you to review
each game, of which the written review will only appear when the game is clicked on while a 5 star rating is
planned to appear next to the name in the recycler view preview, and specify whether you actually finished
it or not, which will have an updating icon next to the 5 star review. Users will be able to add in games
by clicking on a button that adds items to the recycler view that represents a new game to keep track of
and be reviewed.

Concepts planned to be used:
-Recycler View
-Activities
-Fragments
-Buttons
-Fomatting and Themes
-Checkbox
-Icon
